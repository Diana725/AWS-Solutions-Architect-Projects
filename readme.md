# Demos and Mini Projects for AWS


This repo stores a collection of demos and projects that I have implemented in the course of my AWS Solutions Architect Journey. The Demos are available in instruction, architecture diagrams, and images.

Most of the projects here will have this structure:

* One-Click Deployment 
* Lab Setup
* Lab Instructions

## HERE ARE THE PROJECTS FEATURED
* [Fully Elastic and Scalable Web Application Architecture](https://github.com/Diana725/AWS-Solutions-Architect-Projects/tree/main/Fully%20Elastic%20and%20Scalable%20Web%20Application%20Architecture)
* Implement Serverless Application

## CREDITS
I have learnt and used most of the lab setups from [learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) so feel free to check the repository up.
