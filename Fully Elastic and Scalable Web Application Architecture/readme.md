## Fully Elastic and Scalable Web Application Architecture
In this project, I evolved the architecture of a wordpress application from a manually built single instance to a scalable, elastic, and resilient architecture. The project consisted of 6 steps, each implementing additional components of the architecure:
* [Step 1](https://github.com/Diana725/AWS-Solutions-Architect-Projects/tree/main/Fully%20Elastic%20and%20Scalable%20Web%20Application%20Architecture/Step%201) - Setup the environment manually and build wordpress
* Step 2 - Automate the build process using a Launch Template
* Step 3 - Split out the DB into RDS and update the Lauch Template
* Step 4 - Split the wordpress file system into EFS and update the Launch Template
* Step 5 - Enable Elasticity using an Autoscaling Group and Application Load Balancer and fix wordpress
* Step 6 - Cleanup
